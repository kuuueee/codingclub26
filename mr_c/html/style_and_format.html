		<h2>Styling html elements with cascading style sheets (css)</h2> 

        <hr>
		<h4>We ended last session learning about how javascript interacts with html</h4>
		<h3>The next step is to learn how to use css to apply formating rules which can then also be controlled with javascript.</h3>
		<pre>
            A handy way of looking at websites is to describe the parts of the site with new more descriptive names.

            For example, your mouse is called a cursor because it can be moved not only with a mouse, but also with your finger on a smartphone.

            For us, the document that we are manipulating is called the DOM (Document object model)

            In the same way your cursor can be moved by a mouse or a touch, the DOM can be manipulated by any of the files related to the document you are working on.

            In this next tutorial I will have you set up three files that you will work on inside your project directory.
            But only one Document object model will be viewed with google chrome: your no_style.html file.
        </pre>
    
        <h3>Boring Prework to get your project directory set up</h3>

        <pre>
            In finder, navigate to mr_c/project_template

            Grab the entire folder named : website_template and copy to your NONAME flash drive.

            It should be at the same hierarchy as the folder with your name
        </pre>

        <hr>
        <pre>
            In finder, navigate to website_template/index.html and open index.html with chrome.
                You should see home, style and no style. Click no style.

            Notice that there is no colour, things look kind of ok, but not great.

            Now click style. Notice the rainbow, things look ok, not great but much better than nothing!

            Now open both style and no_style.html in visual studio and look for line 5.

            You should find a line in no_style that it not in style. This line is : &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/altstyle.css"&gt;
        </pre>

        <hr>

        <pre>
            If you are not having a relevation right now, what this means is that these documents are identical except for one line : the css file that controls the html document about colour and format.
            
            And by editing this file, or perhaps the properties in this file with javascript we are now on our way to basic animations.

            What I would like you to do right now is to open up home.css and notice how the rules are applied to the elements.

            Now open up altstyle.css in visual studio and start applying diffrent rules to the elements.

            You can observe any changes you make to this file by viewing no_style.html in google chrome.
        </pre>

        <pre>
            Start by copying just the h1 element. You can change many things, but colour is the easiest for me to see immediately.

            Now keep going and apply rules to every element in nostyle.html

            You can do whatever you want and you are even able to change the background image. Can you figure out how do do that?

        </pre>

                <hr>

        <p>
            That was kind of a boring lesson but I don't think we will have much time for more today.
            Here is some inspiration of what I wish to be able to show you how to make in the future using these basic lessons.

        <h3>You can use javascript to change css values.</h3>
        <div class="square" id="colourSquare"></div>
        <pre>Enter a number</pre>
        <input id="base10input" type="number" id="base10" onchange="convertbase10()">
        <input id="base16output" type="text" id="base16" readonly="readonly">
