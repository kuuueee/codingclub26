		<h2>Mechanisms of your button</h2> <p>Clicks: <a id="clicks">0</a></p>
		<hr>
		<h4>We ended last session with a button that counts up.</h4>
		<h3>To be able to craft new ideas, let me walk you through how the components work</h3>
		<pre>
	Take a look at the following HTML code that produces a the counter button in your program:

		&lt;button type="button" onclick="hello()"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; <button type="button" onclick="hello()">Click me</button> 
			
	Now let's look at a new button, this time it's empty : 

		&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt; <button></button> &lt;--- There is a button here

	Here are the elements of the button and what they do:
			
		Element text     : The text that appears on the button. Our example says "Click me" 
		Element type     : The type of button that this is, such as reset, submit <a href="">element types</a>
		Element event    : How the function will react. There are many <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Jsref/dom_obj_event.asp">events</a>, in our example it will be when the button is clicked.
		Element function : The function that is executed when the button is pressed. Our example says "hello()"
		</pre>

		<h4>Let's edit your counter.js files</h4>

		<pre>
	The first thing we are going to do is define a function named alt_count().

	Functions in javascript are comprised of a few things.

	We need a name for the function : have that.

	We need to tell our javascript file that this is a function : 

	function alt_count()

	We need arguments that our function will use when executing these arguments : 

			Let's save that thought for later and come back to it.
				Normally we would put these inside the smooth braces : alt_count(counterValue)

	We need the function to do something. Everything that a function does is encapsulated in curly braces : {}
	
	If we put all of this together we have : 

		function alt_count()
		{

		}

	And just for fun, let's add this to our function :

		var placeholderText = "foobar";
		var id = "targetId"
		document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = placeholderText;

	This code, will change any the text of any id with the name "targetId" to foobar
	</pre>

	<h4>Reference your javascript function in an html element.</h4>

	<pre>
	Open your counter.html file.

	Inside the body of your html file: create a new paragraph element with the id "targetId"

	Here is one you can copy if you want : &lt;p&gt;Barfoo &lt;a id="targetId"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	Now here is where you need to create a new button based on the information above.

	You can name the button anything. In my example I will demonstrate below I put "If you click me i'll change!"

	The button type is button

	The button event is onclick

	You just named the function alt_count()
	</pre>

	<h3>Demo</h3>

	<pre>
		This is the functionality you can expect if you've followed along so far
		<p>This will stay | <a id="targetId">This wont</a></p>
		<button type="button" onclick="alt_count()">If you click me i'll change!</button> 
	</pre>

	<pre>
	Okay so we know how to make two simple buttons.
	Now I need to ask you to go past this part with your imagination if you can.

	The thing that I would like you do figure out is this.

	You have one place in your counter.html where a number is added to. The id of this is called : clicks

	I would like you to create two (or more) buttons that do various actions to the same number.

	I will show you only an example for this below:

	</pre>

	<p>New Counter | <a id="newClicks">0</a></p>

	<button type="button" onclick="new_action('add');">Add</button>
	<button type="button" onclick="new_action('subtract');">Subtract</button>
	<button type="button" onclick="new_action('square');">Square</button>
	<button type="button" onclick="new_action('cube');">Cube</button>

	</div>
	
	</div> 
	</body>
</html>
