			<h2>Upkeep Your Homepage</h2>
			<h4>What you have acheived so far (or are currently working toward):</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>A homepage</li>
				<li>A navigation bar</li>
				<li>A link somewhere to Mr. C's Tutorials page (So you can easily navigate back and forth)</li>
				<li>A new page</li>
				<li>Random html elements and css rules that apply to your html elements</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>And here is a list of things that I wished you might learn by doing those things:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Your html page can link to all sorts of things, including css and js files (we will learn about these later).</li>
				<li>You can link these files to make your homepages in the header</li>
				<li>Every element in your html file is defined after the open and before the closing tag: &lt;span style="color: #0000a0" &gt; <span style="color: #0000a0">What you see in your browser</span>&lt;/span&gt;</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Today's goal is to tidy up your home page and template page such that the following is true:</h4>
			<pre>
		0. You are all caught up to the tutorials:
		1. All of the navigation links work
		2. CSS is applied correctly to all of your pages
		3. All of your html is valid when you copy and paste your code to the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">validator.</a>
			</pre>
